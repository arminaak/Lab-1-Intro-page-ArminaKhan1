    <p>  My name is Armina Khan, and I am 15 years old. I am in 10th grade, and have transferred this year. Therefore, this is my first year at Thomas Edison. I am taking a Web Development class this year for my shop class. I have taken a couple courses on Web Development in the past, so I have some prior knowledge on Web Development. </p>
